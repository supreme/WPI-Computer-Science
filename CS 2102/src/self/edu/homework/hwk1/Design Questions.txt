1. It would be possible to construct this type of match as long as the results for the other
   kind of contest implemented the 'IResult' interface. You would run into errors though when
   you attempted to call the winner() method since we determine the type of object we have
   before calculating the winner.

2. Our code allows this match to be created since the design pattern issued in the assignment
   makes use of type casting through the 'IContestant' and 'IResult' interfaces.

3. Yes. We could prevent this by verifying that each team is of the same type via the instanceof operator.
   Additionally we would also have to check that the results of the match are of the correct type in the
   same manner.
